# Models Overview

Models overview
The Bangladesh Tropical Cyclone Probabilistic Historical Catalogue catastrophe models were created jointly between the UK Met Office, BUET, Catrisks Solutions and Oasis Palmtree as part of the ‘Oasis Platform for Climate and Catastrophe Risk Assessment – Asia’ project, supported by the International Climate Initiative (IKI) and the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, based on a decision of the Germany Bundestag.
The models comprise an ensemble event catalogue representing the wind and storm surge hazard of 12 Tropical Cyclones that affected Bangladesh between 1991 and 2019.
